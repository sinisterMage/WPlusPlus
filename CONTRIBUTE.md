## âœ¨ How to Contribute

If you're here, you're already awesome. Here's how to level up your awesomeness:

1. **Fork this repo**
   Classic GitHub ritual. Do it.

2. **Do whatever improvement your heart desires**

   * Fix a bug
   * Add a feature
   * Write docs
   * Add a meme
   * Even changing or adding **just one line** is much appreciated ðŸ’™

3. **Open a Pull Request**
   Iâ€™ll review it and **probably accept it ASAP** unless it starts a war with the garbage collector.

## ðŸ§  No Contribution Too Small

Whether it's fixing a typo, refactoring a function, or drawing ASCII sloths â€” **it matters**.

So go wild. W++ was born from chaos, memes, and a desire to make programming fun again.

# W++ 🦥  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e55dc88e-7ef0-4aa6-8d3e-fbb77c9aac08)

> *At least we’re better than Visual Basic.*

**W++** is a fun, experimental, and completely over-engineered programming language designed for learning, chaos, and memes.  
It includes async lambdas, pseudo-OOPSIE principles (Object-Oriented Programming Sometimes Isn’t Excellent), and full integration with a custom-built VSCode extension.

This repo contains the full source code of W++ after it reached over **33,000 downloads** on the VSCode Marketplace — and was mysteriously flagged and removed.

## ✨ Features

- ✅ Full tokenizer, parser, and interpreter written in C#
- ✅ Async/await support
- ✅ Lambda expressions (single and multi-param)
- ✅ Control flow: `if`, `else`, `while`, `for`, `switch`
- ✅ Try/catch + `throw` and `return`
- ✅ Custom syntax highlighting and snippets in VSCode
- ✅ The **OOPSIE** model of development (trust us, it’s revolutionary)

## 🧠 Why does W++ exist?

This project was created by [Ofek Bickel](https://github.com/sinisterMage) as an educational challenge — to build a real, working language from scratch and share it with the world.

We believe that even chaotic, meme-fueled languages can teach real-world compiler and runtime skills — and spark joy while doing it.

## 🧪 Example

wpp
let greet = (name) => {
    print "Hello, " + name;
};

greet("world");

## 🆕 NEW!! Homebrew Support 🍺

You can now install the W++ CLI tool (`ingot`) directly on macOS using Homebrew!

### ✅ Quick Install

```bash
brew tap sinistermage/wpp
brew install wpp
```

This installs the `ingot` CLI globally — ready to run `.wpp` scripts from anywhere.

### 🔄 Updates

To upgrade in the future:

```bash
brew upgrade wpp
```

> Powered by ✨ sloths, GitHub Actions, and definitely *not* Visual Basic.

## 🤔 Is W++ a Python dialect?

Nope. W++ borrows Python’s readability and indentation style, but it is **not** Python or a Python runtime.

- It’s not compatible with Python libraries
- It has a custom syntax, runtime, and execution model
- It compiles to IL and integrates tightly with the .NET ecosystem
- It uses semicolons and braces by design
- It supports NuGet imports — not pip

Think of it as:  
**“.NET scripting with a Python-inspired flavor”** — not “Python on .NET” (that’s IronPython).

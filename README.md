## ðŸš€ W++ v2 â€” The LLVM Era Begins

Hey everyone ðŸ‘‹

Soâ€¦ Iâ€™ve decided to take a *big* step.
Iâ€™m officially **discontinuing the old C#-based W++ interpreter.**

I know, I know â€” itâ€™s controversial. Some of you might not like it.
But hear me out: itâ€™s time for W++ to *evolve.*

The C# interpreter was a fantastic **learning tool** â€” it taught me how to build a language, design a runtime, and survive the chaos that is C# async debugging.
But now, to make W++ truly *good* (or at least *less cursed*), itâ€™s time for something stronger.

Enter: **W++ v2** ðŸ¦¾
A full rewrite of W++ powered by **LLVM** â€” faster, cleaner, and slightly less explosive.
(We canâ€™t promise bug-free â€” this is still W++, after all â€” but hey, we can dream.)

W++ v2 will:

* âš¡ Run faster than ever before
* ðŸ§  Gain real optimization potential
* ðŸ§© Have a proper compiler pipeline
* ðŸ’€ Still occasionally do weird things for no reason

This marks the start of a new era for the sloth-fueled chaos engine we all love.
Thanks for sticking around, respecting my decision, and helping push W++ forward into the LLVM future.

Letâ€™s make **W++ v2** something even more ridiculous â€” and *actually usable*.

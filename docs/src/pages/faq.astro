    <h1>❓ Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

    <details>
      <summary>🤔 Why is it called W++?</summary>
      <p>
        I took the name from the gaming world — <strong>W</strong> means a "win", so <strong>W++</strong> means "win++" — always stacking Ws.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>🦥 What does OOPSIE stand for?</summary>
      <p>
        <strong>Object-Oriented Programming Sometimes Isn’t Excellent.</strong>
        A philosophy. A lifestyle. A mistake turned into a framework.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>💥 Is W++ production-ready?</summary>
      <p>
        Only if your production environment thrives on chaos and irony.
        For real-world use, consult your inner sloth.
      </p>

    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>🛠️ Can I extend W++ with plugins?</summary>
      <p>
        Yes! Write your plugin in C#, or summon an entity that alters reality.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>📦 How is W++ installed?</summary>
      <p>
        Use the <code>ingot</code> CLI or the GUI installer. For advanced souls, build from source with .NET.

    <details>
      <summary>🎭 Is this a joke?</summary>
      <p>
        We like to take life in a humorous way — but the language works. Mostly.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>🧠 Does it support AI?</summary>

        Of course! The W++ installer comes with a baked-in <strong>Annoying Intelligence™</strong>.

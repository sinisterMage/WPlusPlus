## 🧠 The W++ vs Microsoft Story: A Tale of Open Source, Corporates, and Sloths

On **May 11th, 2025**, in the very early days of W++, I uploaded a simple extension for W++ to the [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/).

It quickly took off — within hours, it reached **over 33,000 downloads**.

And then... Microsoft **took it down**.  
No warning. No explanation. Just gone.

### 🕵️ What happened next?

After digging deeper, I discovered I wasn’t alone.  
Another dev on Reddit had a similar experience — their extension hit **100K downloads** and was also removed.

Eventually, I found that my extension was publicly listed in Microsoft’s own repo as removed for “**Malware**”:  
📄 [OfekBickel.wpp – RemovedPackages.md](https://github.com/microsoft/vsmarketplace/blob/main/RemovedPackages.md)

### 📨 What did Microsoft say?

I opened an issue on their GitHub repo:  
🔗 [Issue #1251 on microsoft/vsmarketplace](https://github.com/microsoft/vsmarketplace/issues/1251)

They responded… with an **email address**.  
I emailed them. No reply.  
I even tried **calling them**.

Nothing.

### 🧬 My response?

Transparency.

I chose to **open-source W++**, including:
- The language
- The CLI (`ingot`)
- The VS Code extension itself

So that **anyone** could audit it, use it, or fork it.

---

### 🧠 TL;DR:

- W++ became too cool too fast
- Microsoft flagged it as malware
- Nobody explained why
- So I open-sourced everything, sloth-powered and chaos-fueled

This isn’t just a story of a flagged extension.  
It’s a story about how open source survives — even when big tech isn’t ready for sloths running programming languages.
